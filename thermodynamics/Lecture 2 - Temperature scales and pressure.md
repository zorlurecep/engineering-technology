# Lecture 2 - Temperature scales and pressure

### State and Equilibrium

- **Equilibrium:** A state of balance.
  - In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials (or driving forces) within the system.
- **Thermal Equilibrium:** If the temperature is the same throughout the entire system.
- **Mechanical Equilibrium:** If there is no change in pressure at any point of the system with time.
- **Phase Equilibrium:** If a system involves two phases and when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium level and stays there.
- **Chemical Equilibrium:**  If the chemical composition of a system does not change with time, that is, no chemical reactions occur.

### The state Postulate

- The number of properties required to fix the state of a system is given by

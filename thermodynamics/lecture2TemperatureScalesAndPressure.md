# Lecture 2 - Temperature scales and pressure

### State and Equilibrium

- **Equilibrium:** A state of balance.
  - In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials (or driving forces) within the system.
- **Thermal Equilibrium:** If the temperature is the same throughout the entire system.
- **Mechanical Equilibrium:** If there is no change in pressure at any point of the system with time.
- **Phase Equilibrium:** If a system involves two phases and when the mass of each phase reaches an equilibrium level and stays there.
- **Chemical Equilibrium:**  If the chemical composition of a system does not change with time, that is, no chemical reactions occur.

### The state Postulate

- The number of properties required to fix the state of a system is given by the **state postulate**:
  - The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties.

- **Simple Compressible System:** If a system involves no, electrical, magnetic, gravitational, motion, abd surface tension effects.

### Processes and Cycles

- **Process:** Any change that a system undergoes from one equilibrium state to another.
- **Path:** The series of states through which a system passes during a process.
  - To describe a process completely, one should specify inital and final states, as well as the path it follows, and the interactions with the surroundings.
- **Quasistatic or Quasi-equilibrium process:** When a process proceeds in such a manner that the system remains infinitesimally close to an equilibrium state at all times.
- **Isothermal Process:** A process during which the temperature T remains constant.
- **Isobaric Process:** A process during which the pressure P remains constant.
- **Isochoric (or Isometric) Process:** A process during which the specific volume v remains constant.
- **Cycle:** A process during which the initial and final states are identical.

### The Steady-Flow Process

- The term *steady* implies no change with time. The opposite of steay is *unsteady*, or *transient*.
- A large number of engineering devices operate for long periods of time under the same conditions, and they are classified as *steady-flow devices*.
- **Steady-flow process:** A process during which a fluid flows through a control volume steadily.  
  - e.g: Turbines, pumps, boilers, condensers, and heat exchangers or power plants or refrigeration systems.

### Temperature and The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

- **The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:** If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- By replacing the third body with a thermometer, the zeroth law can be restated as *two bodies are in thermal equilibrium if both have the same temperature reading even if they are not in contact*.

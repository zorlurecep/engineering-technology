# Introduction to Thermodynamics

- **Thermodynamics:** The science of energy.
- **Energy:** The ability to cause changes.
- **Conservation of energy principle:** During an interaction, energy can change from one form to another but the total amount of energy remains constant.
  - Energy can't be created or destroyed.
- **The first law of thermodynamics:** An expression of the conservation of energy principle.
  - The first law asserts that _energy_ is a thermodynamic property.
- **The second law of thermodynamics:** It asserts that energy has _quality_ as well as _quantity_, and actual processes occur in the direction of decreasing quality of energy.
- **Classical Thermodynamics:** A _macroscopic approach_ to the study of thermodynamics that does not require a knowledge of behavior of individual particles.
- **Statistical Thermodynamics:** A _microscopic approach_, based on the behavior of large groupds of individual particles.
- **Macroscopic Point of View:** Bulk Energy flow.
- **Microscopic Point of View:** Structure of matter; molecular interactions.
- **Application areas of thermodynamics:** All activities in nature involve some interaction between energy and matter; thus, it is hard to image in a area that does not relate to thermodynamics in some manner.
- **Primary (Fundamental) Dimensions:** Basic dimensions such as mass, length, time, and temperature.
- **Secondary Dimensions:** Expressed in terms of the primary dimensions.
- _There is no conversion factor between mechanical and electrical system in the m,kg,s units._
- **Coherent Systems** is a system of units, used to measure physical quantities, which are defined in such a way that the equations relating the numerical values expressed in the units of the system have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations directly relating the quantities. Equivalently, it is a system in which every quantity has a unique unit, or one that does not use **conversion factors.**
- **System:** A quantity of matter or a region in space chosen for study.
- **Surroundings:** The mass or the region outside of the system.
- **Boundary:** The real or imaginary surface that separates the system from its surroundings.
  - The boundary of a system can be _fixed_ or _movable_.
- The system can be considered to be _closed_ or _open_.
- **Closed Systems(Control mass):** A fixed amount of mass, and no mass can cross its boundary.
- **Open system (control volume):** A properly selected region in space.
  - Both mass and energy can cross the boundary of a control volume.
  - It usually encloses a device that involves mass flow such as a compressorl, turbine, or nozzle.
- **Control Surface:** The boundaries of a control volume.
  - It can be real or imaginary.
- **Isolated System:** no interaction with surroundings.
- **Property:** Any characteristic of a system.
  - Such as pressure P, temperature T, voluem V, and mass m.
- **Intensive Properties:** Those that are independent of the mass of a system, such as temperature, pressure,and density.
- **Extensive Properties:** Those whose values depend on the size -or extend- of the system.
- **Specific Properties:** Extensive properties per unit mass.
- Matter is made up of atoms that are widely spaced in the gas phase. Yet it is very convenient to disregard the atomic nature of a substance and view it as a continuous, homogeneous matter with no holes, that is, a **continuum**.
  - The continuum idealization allows us to treat properties as point functions and to assume the properties vary continually in space with no jump disontinuities.
  - Is valid as long as the size of the system we deal with is large relative to the space between the molecules. This is the case in practically all problems.

- **Density** $\rho = \frac{m}{V} (kg/m^3)$
- **Specific volume** $v = \frac{V}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho}$
- **Specific Gravity:** The ratio of the density of a substance to the density of some standard substance at a specified temperature (usually water at $4 \degree$).  
$SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho (H2O)}$
- **Specific weight:** The weight of a unit volume of a substance.  
$\gamma = \rho g (N/m^3)$
